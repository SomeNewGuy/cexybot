Setup
=====

Find: api=cexapi.api('USERNAME','ApiKey','ApiSecret')
Than insert your own information and run via cmd line.
ie: python.exe cexybot.py

What this does is maintain a 50/50 balance on your account of BTC/GHS. Example, if GHS devalues it will buy more. On the flip side, if it raises in value, it will sell. It is by no means a get rich profit bot. I will allow you to be away from your account longer safely without coming back and having lost 20% of your GHS value due to not being there to sell etc. In the long run it will make you some money, again not a get rich quick bot.
